Hi there! I'm Taylor Justason, a wildlife biologist with a passion for conservation and protected areas. Growing up in the Pacific Northwest, I was surrounded by the beauty of nature and I knew from a young age that I wanted to dedicate my career to protecting it.

I have almost four years of experience in conservation and natural resource management, having worked in Canada, Indonesia, and with international partners from diverse backgrounds. Currently, I work as an ecologist for Parks Canada where I contribute to ecology and conservation projects in Elk Island and Nahanni National Parks. I have experience with endangered species action planning, wildlife monitoring, Indigenous knowledge integration, and grizzly bear tracking.

My academic background is also strong, having received a BSc in Biology from the University of British Columbia with distinction, specializing in ecology and natural resource management. I have worked on various research projects, including the global trade in seahorses and balancing human and wildlife uses of parks. I am also skilled in technical writing, familiar with Microsoft Office, and proficient in R programming.

In addition to my language abilities in English, I also have working knowledge of French, Italian, and Spanish. I am excited about the opportunity to make a positive impact on nature and people through my work in conservation.
